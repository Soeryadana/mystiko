        The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a
        series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword.
        It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.

      >
        The Affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where
        each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent,
        encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a
        letter.

        The least significant bit is the part of the binary data sequence (base
        two) that has the least significant/smallest value. It is located on the
        far right of the bit sequence.
